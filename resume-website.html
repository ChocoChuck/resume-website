      <!-- <div id = "Summary"> -->

        <p>I was born March 3, 1997 in Brooklyn, New York. I've lived in New York my entire life and have loved every second of it. The "Big Apple" is indeed worth the hype. I am African-American, more specifically Nigerian. I went to Medgar Evers College Preparatory School for high school and now attend John Jay College for Criminal Justice. I used be a high school and college basketball player but gave up that life to pursue a career in computer programming. I am a computer science major and I tend to code in my free time.
